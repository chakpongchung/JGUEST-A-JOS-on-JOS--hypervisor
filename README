Introduction
JGUEST-A basic paravirtual hypervisor with support for running filesystem and networking in guest operating system. Through this I ran MIT JOS operating system as guest on MIT JOS operating system as host. I used bochs x86 emulator, which has support for Intel's VT-x hardware support. 

ON GUEST OPERATING SYSTEM
I was able to perform file related operations like creating directories and files, writing to files and also was able to serve these files to outside work by running HTTP server.

I was also also running HTTP server on GUEST operating system and was able to serve HTTP pages to outside world

Implemantation Overview:
1. bootstrapping a guest OS
2. Programming extended page tables
3. emulating privileged instructions,
4. Using Hypercalls to implement hard drive emulation over a disk image file
5. Using Hypercalls Network driver emulation over Network Driver E000 NIC
